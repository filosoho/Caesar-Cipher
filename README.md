# Caesar-Cipher
This is a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher. The program takes a message from the user and encrypts or decrypts it based on the user's choice. The user also inputs the shift number, which determines the amount by which each letter in the message is shifted.

# Prerequisites
You should have:
~~~
Python 3
~~~
installed on your computer.

# Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the program:
~~~
main.py.
~~~

# How to Use
When you run the program, you will be prompted to choose whether you want to encode or decode a message. If you choose to encode, you will then be prompted to enter the message you want to encrypt. If you choose to decode, you will be prompted to enter the message you want to decrypt. After entering the message, you will be prompted to enter the shift number. The shift number determines the amount by which each letter in the message is shifted. The program will then output the encrypted or decrypted message.

You can continue to encrypt or decrypt messages by typing 'y' when prompted to continue. If you want to quit the program, type 'n'.
